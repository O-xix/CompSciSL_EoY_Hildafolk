- Hello! This is Teja Dasari's and Adam Hung's End Of Year Project for Computer Science.
- We haven't actually been using any Java IDE's like IntelliJ, which actually formats the file directory into src folders and such.
- But these are all the files necessary. A Main class, and a few other classes.
- This project has a lot of broken functionalities here and there, 
- like we wanted to implement a maze where you would have random battles, and the sprite on the Drawing Panel would actually move, but we never actually got to that.
- There may also also some algorithm structures wrong with the Items, and the battle isn't really short, due to the amount of misses and evasion chances we give our objects.
- So this is very much incomplete.
